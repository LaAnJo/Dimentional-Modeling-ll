# Flight Dimensional Model

This repository contains an Excel-based dimensional data model designed for analyzing flight operations and performance within a business intelligence (BI) and data warehousing context. The model follows a star schema architecture, which is widely used to support efficient analytical querying and reporting.

At the center of the model is the Fact_Flights table, which captures key measurable metrics such as flight duration, distance, delays, and operational counts. Surrounding the fact table are several dimension tables—including Date, Airline, Airport, Route, and Aircraft—that provide descriptive attributes used for filtering, grouping, and slicing the data across different analytical perspectives.

The dimensional design enables:

Fast and intuitive analytical queries

Time-based, route-based, and airline-level analysis

Simplified reporting and dashboard development in BI tools

This Excel model is intended for educational, prototyping, and demonstration purposes, and can serve as a foundation for building dashboards, performing exploratory analysis, or extending into a full data warehouse implementation.
